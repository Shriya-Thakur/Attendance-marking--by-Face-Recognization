# Attendance-marking--by-Face-Recognization

This is an attendance project that will use a webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet.
Open CV is used for preprocessing the images and detection of faces is done through HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Method.
The detected faces run through a pre-trained CNN model to get the 128 measurements for each face.
